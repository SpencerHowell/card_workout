## About

The CARD Workout app allows users to follow along with a full-body workout that is randomized
based on the model of a deck of cards. Each suit represents a category of exercise, and the rank
of the card determines how many reps must be done. Each exercise category has four associated movements,
which are rotated through as the workout proceeds. Drawing an ace results in a rest timer.

At the end of the workout, users are able to review the sets that they performed. By keeping the
workouts randomized and unique, the CARD workout allows for training at home to stay fresh and exciting.

The CARD Workout app is based heavily off of the program described by Jeff Nippard in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLrkT4F7tEc).

## Technology
  
The CARD Workout app was developed using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language.  
    
While it should be able to deploy on Android and iOS devices, it has only been tested for Android.  
If you're interested in working with me to test on iOS, please reach out!
  
## Development

To build the CARD Workout app, you will first need to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Android Studio was the IDE used to develop this application, but Visual Studio Code should work just as well.

Once you have installed Flutter, you will need to run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies for the app.

The last step is to connect a device or launch an emulator, and run the app with your IDE or with `flutter run`
